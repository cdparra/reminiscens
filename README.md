Reminiscens
===================================================================

Reminiscens is a social informatics project funded by the <a href="http://www.lifeparticipation.org/"> 
Lifeparticipation Research Group</a> at the <a href="http://www.disi.unitn.it/"> University of Trento </a>. It is 
the result of participatory research action and design with local elders, with the goal of motivating face to face 
social interactions between older adults and their younger relatives. Not only we have worked on designing an 
application, but we have worked to build an interesting knowledge base of content that will stimulate people to 
reminisce. 

Reminiscens is a work in progress, part of a Ph.D. in Information and Communication Technologies. This github repo
serves as a supermodule of the main components of this work: 
- The Lifecontext API (https://github.com/cdparra/lifecontext.git) 
- The personal Life API (https://github.com/cdparra/reminiscens-lifeapi.git)
- The reminiscens tablet application (https://github.com/cdparra/reminiscensui.git)

Please, be gentle. This is all work-in-progress made by students that learning by doing :-).
And, of course, feedback is always welcomed.
